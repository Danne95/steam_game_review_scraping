They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hard... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this. I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxicty. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was In a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other sideHaving nothing better to do. I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot.... I must admit. I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact. I may have only played this game a day or two. With that being said, after doing so. I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 wwwwing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okayAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work.

{"thumbs_up":true,"text":"Was thinking for a moment and realised that I really should leave a review for this game. I\u2019ll explain why.Got this game a while ago when a lot of stuff was still not there yet. And it was already a really good game to play on pc. Controls felt really good, weapons nice to use and fairly balanced, cool interaction between some of them and eventually some you could combine. Especially on controller it\u2019s great to play. Keyboard works too but you get better directional control with the joystick so id recommend doing that if possible.Later I got my steam deck, that turned this game into the best portable game I ever owned. Even at home I\u2019d rather grab my steam deck to play this then my desktop. I can\u2019t explain why. It just is prefect for that.At the start already but even more so now that a lot more has been added. This is a surprisingly worked out game. At the start it seems very basic. You move around that\u2019s all you do. The rest is automatic. Yet with just that it still manages to do so much. You unlock weapons, maps, different modes, and depending on how much you look up figure out how everything works yourself. I\u2019d personally recommend not looking stuff up, especially at the start. It\u2019s really cool going through the game and learning what stuff combines together end how everything works.The game is challenging too, at the start I\u2019d really not expect to win. You\u2019ll need a few runs to figure out how to survive and what to prioritise and when. As you do this you\u2019ll also unlock some permanent upgrades that are well balanced in a way that doesn\u2019t make it feel like you\u2019re OP. But mostly just makes any of the more annoying parts about restarting more convenient and keeps it fun to constantly replay.But now why I had to review this. It may not be the best game in my library, it\u2019s not the best looking one or the one I have the most hours on. But it\u2019s one of the only games I own at this price. And with that price its by far the best value for money game I\u2019ve ever bought. And its not even close either. Its so far above anything else in that that I doubt anything will replace that spot in years if at all.The maker of this game could have sold the game for 30 bucks if he wanted. I\u2019m sure it would have sold at that price and still had good reviews. But he didn\u2019t. And not just that, but he also released a dlc that again he could have easily made 15 bucks at least. But again it\u2019s cheaper then a coffee.I appreciate that a lot, many people would have gone for it. But by not doing that I think this game just put itself in a spot that I\u2019d never forget it.This probably is the only game in my library I\u2019d give a proper 10\/10 with no criticism I can give about the game. It\u2019s perfect.","helpful_votes":0,"funny_votes":0,"reward":0,"gametime_record":67.9,"cleaned_text":"think moment realism really lead review game ill explain whygot game ago lot stuff still yet already really good game play pc control felt really good weapon nice use fair balance cool interact event could combine respect control great play keyboard work get better direct control joystick id recommend possiblelat got steam deck turn game best portal game ever own even home id rather grab steam deck play desktop cant explain prefect that start already even lot ad surprise work game start seem basic move around that rest automaton yet still manga much unlock weapon map differ mode depend much look figure every work id person recommend look stuff respect start really cool go game learn stuff combine together end every work game challenge start id really expect win you need run figure survive priority you also unlock german upgrade well balance way doesnt make feel like your op most make annoy part restart convent keep fun constant replaybut review may best game library best look one one hour one game price price far best value money game ive ever bought even close either far any el doubt any replace spot year all maker game could sold game 30 buck want im sure would sold price still good review didnt also release dlc could easily made 15 buck least cheaper coffee appreci lot mani people would gone think game put spot id never forget ichi probably game library id give proper 1010 critic give game perfect"}

{"thumbs_up":true,"text":"Vampire Survivors is a game the what I would label as \"genre-defining.\" It's simple, arcade-y, and cheap, where quick runs of 30 min or less make this addicting but also time-manageable.  Instead of a bullethell where you are dodging, you become the bullethell itself, mowing down classic enemies in vain of Castlevania.Another thing this game does well is how runs can end, and there's always something to improve or scale on. Would this character's starter weapon help here instead of the one I've been using?  Maybe try a different set of weapons? Or a different location entirely? Combinations are meant to be explored, and most times they can amplify the fun.

{"thumbs_up":true,"text":"This game is such a fun time kill overall and appropriately challenging early on for resource appropriation.Starting off is obviously slow without any of the upgrades or heros unlocked but it's made in a way that is approachable to build to the challenge of wanting to and the actuality of surviving a full 30 minutes of wave after wave swarming attacks punctuated with bosses AND THEN a battle with death (and maybe even thereafter! note: thereafter is boss only territory and notably difficult; I highly recommend watching videos\/streams of this content if you are interested).I love the nostalgic graphics throughout the game and game interface. I personally find them to be both satisfying and suitable considering all else that is going on during the wave by wave game. I also enjoy that each ability has its own effects and animation for it. It's quite nice as you gather more to see how they interact together and how the graphic choices don't make it too overwhelming for the eyes even with everything going on.There is also a super nifty feature to make is controller compatible already built in so that is nice, too.I definitely 5\/5 Stars recommend this game if you've got some time to kill and six smackeroos to buy it especially if you like the nostalgic graphics.","helpful_votes":0,"funny_votes":0,"reward":0,"gametime_record":13.6,"cleaned_text":"game fun time kill overall appropri challenge early resource appropriationstart obvious slow without upgrade hero unlock made way approach build challenge want actual survive full 30 minut wave wave swarm attack punctuated bos battle death may even threat note threat bos territory notable difficult high recommend watch videosstream content interested love postal graphic throughout game game interface person find satisfy suitable consider el go wave wave game also enjoy bail effect anim quit nice gather see interact together graphic choice dont make overwhelm eye even every go other also super nifty feature make control combat already built nice took deficit 55 star recommend game you got time kill six smackeroo buy respect like postal graphic"}
